solucion a la conexi√≥n a internet a traves del router en wlan1 con RaspAP en wlan0:


When using a second wifi interface as a bridge (wlan1) the problem is that the metric for the route for wlan1 is higher than the one for wlan0. Adding a higher metric for wlan0 solves the problem:
edit /etc/dhcpcd.conf and add under:
interface wlan0
metric 999

eth0 works fine because when plugged it has a lower metric.

Best solution would be not to add the default route 0.0.0.0 for wlan0 when used in AP mode.
